<h2>About Us</h2>

<h3>About the Webmasters</h3>
<p><strong>Dave Fei</strong> is a fan of Pendleton Ward's famous documentary
of the lives of Jake the Dog and Finn the Human. He wrote some of the html pages for this website because he's really a homeless guy for hire with poor programming skills, no job, and no women. In his spare time (which he probably doesn't have), he participates in screaming contests with the Earl of Lemongrab, gets eye strain from BMO's last-gen graphics, and laughs at how Marceline can't find an appropriate boyfriend/potential spouse because she's more than a thousand years old. Admit it's pretty hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>Chris LaRose</strong> is also a fan of Pendleton Ward's work as well. But remember he's NOT a true fan of <em>Adventure Time</em> because he only watched three episodes. Anyhow, as you know, he's also a Webmaster for this website (even though he could totally do without Dave's help because Chris is a boss (but not really because Justin Giboney IS the boss)).</p>
