CSC 337 Web Programming Project
===============================

Authors: Chris LaRose & Dave Fei

For assignment 5, we followed the tutorial called [Use CSS to create stylish
circular navigation][1]. The tutorial used seven items in the navigation, but
we had only four. The author hardcoded the css-transform values for rotation
and skew, so we calculated what the values should be for four elements.
Additionally, the tutorial used a small polyfills library, we we replaced the
dependency with jQuery.
